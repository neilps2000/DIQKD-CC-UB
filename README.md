The main script is qudit_CC_UB.m, which allows us to calculate an upper bound on the key rate and the critical visibility when using the maximally entangled state or the maximally violating (CGLMP) state.
The script test_locality.m allow us to verify that the correlations obtained with the finite visibility model using the maximally entangled state are local when the visibility is V = C_b/I_d^max, where C_b is the local bound of the CGLMP-inequality and I_d^max is the maximal violation of this inequality by the maximally entangled state for dimension d.
